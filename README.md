# Blockchain Agri Project

## Overview
This project uses blockchain technology and drone-based precision agriculture to detect and treat weeds. It integrates machine learning, IPFS for decentralized storage, and smart contracts for data logging and control.

## Project Structure
- `contracts/`: Contains the smart contracts.
- `migrations/`: Contains migration scripts for deploying contracts.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests for the smart contracts.
- `src/`: Contains source code for the ML model and integration scripts.
- `data/`: Contains training and validation images.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install required software: Node.js, Ganache, Truffle, Python.
2. Create the folder structure and files as outlined.
3. Compile and migrate the smart contract.
4. Train the ML model and save segmented images.
5. Upload segmented images to IPFS.
6. Log data to the blockchain and control drone operations.

## Running the Project
- Use the command line to execute the scripts as needed.
